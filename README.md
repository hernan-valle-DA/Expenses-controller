## Description

This project, **Expenses Controller**, helps you:

* **Record** expenses via a Jupyter Notebook form (using `ipywidgets`).
* **Store** them in a PostgreSQL database.
* **Visualize** summaries and charts of your spending in another notebook acting as a dashboard.

You can run the dataâ€‘entry notebook to add new expenses, then open the dashboard notebook to explore totals by category, trends over time, and more.

---

## Features

* Dynamic form for entering expenses with date, category, detail, and amount.
* PostgreSQL integration via `psycopg2`.
* Automated summary and bar charts with `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
* Fully contained in Jupyter Notebooks for easy experimentation.

---

## Requirements

* Python **3.1** or higher
* PostgreSQL database

**Python libraries** (add to `requirements.txt` or install via `pip`):

```
psycopg2>=2.9.10
pandas>=2.2.0
matplotlib>=3.8.3
seaborn>=0.13.2
ipywidgets>=8.1.5
```

---

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourâ€‘username/expenses-controller.git
   cd expenses-controller
   ```
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Configuration

1. **Database credentials**: Copy `hidden.py.example` to `hidden.py` and enter your own PostgreSQL host, port, database name, user, and password.

   ```python
   # hidden.py
   secrets = {
       'host': 'YOUR_HOST',
       'port': 5432,
       'database': 'your_db',
       'user': 'your_user',
       'pass': 'your_password'
   }
   ```
2. **Create schema**: Run the provided SQL script `schema.sql` against your PostgreSQL instance.

---

## Usage

Launch Jupyter Notebook or Lab in the project folder:

```bash
jupyter lab
# or
jupyter notebook
```

1. **Data Entry**: Open `data_entry.ipynb`, fill out the expense form, and submit to insert records into the database.
2. **Dashboard**: Open `dashboard.ipynb` to view summaries and charts. You can run this notebook any time to visualize existing expenses.

> **Note**: If you already have expenses in your database, you can skip straight to the dashboard notebook.

---

## Database Schema

Below is the SQL to create the required tables. Save this as `schema.sql` and run it before using the notebooks:

```sql
-- Table for categories
CREATE TABLE category (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    cat_name TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Table for transactions
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    cat_id INTEGER REFERENCES category(id),
    tran_date DATE NOT NULL,
    detail TEXT,
    total_amount NUMERIC(12, 2) NOT NULL
);
```
